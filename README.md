# FFMPEG Shortcuts

[ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) is awesome! It a complete command line solution record, convert and stream audio and video. 

I mostly use it to quickly convert / compress video files, but I always forget the commands ðŸ˜•. So I made a few "shortcut" Bash scripts that use (an already installed) ffmpeg that quickly perform the task I want.

### Installation

1. Clone this repo
2. cd ffmpeg-shortcuts
3. chmod +x ffmov && chmod +x ffmp4
4. cp ffmov /usr/local/bin/ffmov
5. cp ffmp4 /usr/local/bin/ffmp4

### Shortcuts

#### ffmp4 

Compresses MP4 videos using its filename and quality parameters. The output file is always "<filename>_c.mp4".

```
ffmp4 my_video.mp4 20
```

#### ffmov

Compresses MOV videos using its filename and quality parameters. The output file is always "<filename>_c.mov".

```
ffmov my_video.mov 20
```
